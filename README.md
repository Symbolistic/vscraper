# VScrape

This is a simple web scraper developed for company use only. Specifically at my current job, this is made to directly scrape through our company built websites and automate repetitive daily tasks such as downloading images, compression, conversion. VScraper handles the downloading images part of the automation, VCompression will handle the compression and conversion of the images to webp format.
